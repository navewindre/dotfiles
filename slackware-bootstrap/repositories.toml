# This is the general repositories configuration file of slpkg:
# /etc/slpkg/repositories.toml
# Updated: 29/09/2024, Version: 5.1.4

# Set 'true' or 'false' to enable or disable the repository you want.
# You can use a mirror not included in this file.

# Notes: Before using a repository, make sure you have read about it.
#        Some repositories are for -current only. Change the mirror
#        if it is necessary. The mirror or every part of the mirror
#        should end with a slash '/' except for git repositories.

# Template to define a binary custom repository.
# At least are required [NAME], ENABLE, MIRROR and TAG options.
# The MIRROR should include the files ChangeLog.txt, PACKAGES.TXT,
# and CHECKSUMS.md5. If the file ChangeLog.txt is located in
# a different branch, it should be set a variable CHANGELOG.
# Example:
# [ALIEN]
# ENABLE = true
# MIRROR = "https://slackware.nl/people/alien/sbrepos/15.0/x86_64/"
# CHANGELOG = "https://slackware.nl/people/alien/sbrepos/"
# TAG = "alien"
